## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Its time complexity is O(n^2).

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple and intuitive sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element and moves it to its final position. It has a time complexity of O(n^2).

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a stable and adaptive sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. Its time complexity is O(n^2).

### Quick Sort

Quick Sort is a fast and efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It's known for its average-case time complexity of O(n log n).

## Performance Comparison

The program provides a performance comparison feature, allowing you to compare the execution times of these sorting algorithms for different input sizes. You can observe how their efficiency varies as the input size increases.
